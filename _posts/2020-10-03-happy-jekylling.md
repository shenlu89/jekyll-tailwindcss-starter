Recently, I'm planing to learn something new, like Statistics and Mathematics, to get rid of boredom at work. Then I found I need appropriate platform to post my study notes. So I decide to upgrade my personal blog that meets the needs of:

1. Use Tailwind CSS to uniform the layout of website
2. Uniform CSS Style and make it as simple as possible
3. Must support Latex and Code syntax highlighting

For fulfilling these needs, I decide to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as engine to generate my blog template. Jekyll has a low barrier to entry, which means it's very easy to learn even the front-end beginners who only know the basic HTML, CSS and Markdown. In addition, Jekyll can naturally render Markdown and Liquid combined with HTML files and load content from YAML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files by default, which allows me just concentrate on writing content and designing project structure.

The CSS framework I prefer to use is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I think the utility-first mode is being the next generation of CSS framework, althrough I'm not familiar with it. So rebuilding blog is a good opportunity to learn it from zero.

After refactoring blog, I published its theme, named as **Jekyll Tailwindcss Starter** , with some articles to help others learn to develop a static website with Jekyll and Tailwind.

Thatâ€™s all. Thanks for stopping by and happy jekylling! ðŸ˜Š
