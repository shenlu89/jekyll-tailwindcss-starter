Recently I'm planing to rebuild my personal blog to meet the needs of:

1. Generate easily with clean project structure
2. Use Tailwind CSS to uniform the layout of website
3. Uniform CSS Style and make it as simple as possible
4. Features as many as possible

The static website generater I perfer to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) because of its low barrier of entry. Jekyll's philosophy is very easy to understand even someone only know the basic HTML, CSS and Markdown format, which will save much time on reading tutorials and docs.

The CSS framework I would like to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). Althrough I'm not familiar with it, I think the mode of utility-first wil be the next generation of CSS framework and this blog upgrade is also a good chance to learn how to use it from zero.

After rebuiding my blog, I pulished this theme named as **Jekyll Tailwindcss Starter** and post some essays to help you learning Jekyll and Tailwind CSS via developing a static website step by step.

Happy Jekylling! ðŸ˜Š
