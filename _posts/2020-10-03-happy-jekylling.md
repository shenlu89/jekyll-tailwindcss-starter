Recently, I'm planing to learn something new, like Statistics and Mathematics, to get rid of boredom at work. Then I found I need appropriate platform to post my study notes. So I decide to upgrade my personal blog that MUST meet the needs of:

1. Flexible styling system and compatibility with Mordern Browsers
2. Must support Latex and Code syntax highlighting

For fulfilling these need, I decide to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) as engine to generate my blog template and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) as styling system.

Jekyll is my favorite static generator. it has a very low barrier to entry, which means even the front-end beginners, who only know the basic HTML, CSS and Markdown, can also quickly learn it. In addition, Jekyll can naturally render Markdown and Liquid combined with HTML files and load content from YAML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files by default, which allows me to concentrate on writing content and designing project structure.

In sytling system, I prefer to use Tailwind as CSS framework. It constrains style with consistent values, including color choices, spacing, typography and so on, instead of littering your stylesheets with arbitrary values. Not only is it an out-of-box framework by defulat configuration, it can also be configured flexibly as you need. Moreover, I'm not familiar with using Tailwind right now, so it's a good opportunity to learn that from zero. And I think the utility-first mode is being the future of CSS framework.

After refactoring my blog, I published the theme, named as **Jekyll Tailwindcss Starter** temporally, with some articles to help others learn to develop a static website with Jekyll and Tailwind.

Thatâ€™s all. Thanks for stopping by and happy jekylling! ðŸ˜Š
